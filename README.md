=============

Write code in a programming language of your choice to demonstrate: 
* Class
* Object can be created from Class
* Encapsulation
* Data Abstraction
* Inheritance 
* Polymorphism (both static and dynamic)

Please update this README that explains how your code demonstrates these required concepts.

* Class
* Object can be created from Class

Code consist of 6 java files each consist of classes and object created from them.

* Encapsulation
In class mainWithEncap the data encap methods setEncap,getEncap,new1 they are treated as a single component named mainwithEncap(although all the class do the same intentionaly done to demonstrate abstraction).

* Data Abstraction
The AbsClass is an abstracted class which consist of abstract method named getName.AbsChild which is inherited class ofAbsclass had the definition of the abstract class's method. 

* Inheritance 
IneritedClass is inherited from mainWithEncap includes all the funtionalities in both mainWithEncap and inheritedclass ,by using object of inherited class we can access its parent class methods(here new1()).

* Polymorphism (both static and dynamic)
In Overload class the method demo is overloaded based on the value in method call the arguments which matches are called and it is static polymorphism.

An object created with the reference of inheritedclass which calls the method in inherited class.In that super keyword is used to refer a method of parent class named new1()hence the dynamic polymorphism is established.
